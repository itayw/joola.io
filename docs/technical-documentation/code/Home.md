The following section details the JSDoc part of each code file included within the project.
During development, each function, property, event, etc... is documented with a short JSdoc set of tags, these are later
processed during the `build` process and exported as an Markdown format to form the wiki you're viewing now.

### Structure
The strucuture aligns with the `lib` folder of the project's code, each file as its functions, properties, methods and events
detailed with all relevant documentation and know-how.
